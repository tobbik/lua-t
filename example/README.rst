lua-t examples
==============

Overview
++++++++

These are examples that were used to actually develop lua-t.  They have been
adapted over time and been kept up-to-date ... ish.  By the time t.Test was
introduced most examples had been retired and got out of date.

They should be all in a working state now, but they do not necessarily show
the best way how things should be done.  Keep in mind all this code is
example and toy code, non of this is EVER meant to be in production.  You
have been warned.
